This is a mirror of http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=4697

This plugin adds the ]m, ]M, [m, [M motions for perl scripts. 

Vim already supports these motions but they are available only for certain languages.

]m - jump to the next perl subroutine start
]M - jump to the next perl subroutine end
[m - jump to previous perl subroutine start
[M - jump to previous perl subroutine end

CAVEATS:
1. Does not preserve the jump list nor the ` mark (previous position)
2. There is small issue when using it with operators (e.g. yank copies the subroutine but leaves the last brace off)
3. Visual selection operator is unsupported
